# Data Structures Showdown

You've built data structures before, but now it's time to make decisions like an engineer. This unit challenges you to apply what you’ve learned across lists, sets, linked lists, stacks, and queues to real-world problems—while also thinking about performance.

In this assignment, you’ll complete two components:

- **Practice Problems** – Implement solutions to short data structure problems, justify your structure choices, and explain how core operations (like insertion, deletion, or lookup) affect performance.
- **Timed Challenge** – Simulate a real technical interview by solving one structure-based problem under a 30-minute time constraint. You'll also reflect on your decisions and performance trade-offs.

This unit builds your fluency in runtime thinking and prepares you for your final project, where you’ll be expected to select the right structure, explain your reasoning, and solve a problem under pressure—just like you would in a real interview.

To complete this assignment you should:
1. Complete the three problems in `practice_problems.py`. Be sure to include 2–3 sentence comment justifying: (1) Why this data structure fits the task and (2) what operations are performed and their expected runtime
2. Read through the problems in `timed_challenge.txt`. Select one problem that you wish to solve.
3. Copy the selected problem as a comment into `timed_challenge.py`. Set a timer for 30 minutes and complete the problem to the best of your abilities.
4. Create a comment or separate .txt file that provides a brief reflection (200 to 300 words) that answers the following:
    - What structure you chose and why
    - How the time limit shaped your decision 
    - What trade-offs or compromises you made under time pressure
